# LTResources

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook used for the Project of the course Language Technology Resources (University of Gothenburg). The objective of the project is to analyse annotator consistency in data used for an OCR task.

The data used is the newspaper corpus of Kungliga Biblioteket. Only the material from 1818-1904 is publicly available in Kungliga Biblioteketâ€™s website (https://tidningar.kb.se/), because the material from 1905 to 2018 is copyright protected.
